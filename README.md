# Half-Wave Rectifier Analysis with Python 📊🔌

Welcome to the Half-Wave Rectifier Analysis repository, where we explore the fascinating world of electrical engineering and power electronics! 🌟

## Project Overview 📋

In this repository, you'll find Python code implemented in Google Colab to analyze the performance of a half-wave rectifier with diodes. We've divided our analysis into three exciting parts:

**A) Resistive Load (R) 💡**
Discover how a half-wave rectifier behaves under resistive loads. Our Python code calculates average values and RMS values, giving you valuable insights into its characteristics.

**B) Inductive Load (RL) 🔄**
Dive into the impact of inductive loads on the half-wave rectifier's performance. We even employ the powerful `fsolve` function from the `scipy.optimize` library to find the conduction angle of the current. 🧠

**C) Inductive Load with Freewheeling Diode 🆓**
Explore the world of a half-wave rectifier with both an inductive load and a freewheeling diode. Our code provides a comprehensive harmonic analysis, allowing you to understand the harmonic content and behavior of the circuit. 🎵
